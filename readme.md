# CPP-Encryption
An encryption library written in C++

This is a work in progress (WIP) and will most likely have glitches and bugs.
The project is currently not a "library" per se, but a program with a class included. I will be moving it over to be an
actual library once I get the chance to, as well as uploading the releases.

### Encryption Methods
CPP-Encryption currently supports the following encryption methods:
 - Additive encryption
 - XOR encryption

### To-do
- Add additional encryption methods:
   1. [ ] Caesar Cypher
   2. [ ] Vigen√®re Cipher
   3. [ ] Transposition Cipher

### Additional Notes
I likely will not any very complex encryption methods, as that would require a lot of time and effort on my end, but I
honestly have no idea, I could end up trying. The only encryption methods I currently plan to implement are in the list
above.
